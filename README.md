Drag-and-drop grid built with react-redux. Has undo-redo functionality. Application is based around a 2d array of booleans in the redux store- individual cells in the grid are set to show/hide with CSS based on their corresponding boolean in the 2d array. Drag and drop actions update state rather than appending HTML elements.
